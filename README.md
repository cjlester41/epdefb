## Suggestions

- Install pyenv to manage python, pipenv to manage libraries
  + Right now, your project is going to work just on your current machines. 
    If you busted your raspberry pi/needed to swap out bad hardware, you would have to 
    parse out what to install.

- Be critical of your libraries. 
  + How popular is the library? 
  + Is it updated frequently?
  + When was the last time it was updated?

- Use Docker 
- Suggested directory structure provided with epdefb directory. 
- Suggested code changes provided in stub classes 

## Note
- I get a CRLF line separator error when I commit, I may have borked something if "fix and commit" wasn't 
 the right path to take and you're expecting those
